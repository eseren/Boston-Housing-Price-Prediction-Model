# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction-Model

- This is a project for predicting house prices in Boston using machine learning. I utilized the well-known Boston Housing dataset to train models and predict house prices based on various features.

- Analysis		:
  1. The highly correlated feature important to the target variable are indus, nox, and rad. 
  2. The models employed are Lasso and Ridge, utilizing a set of 10 features.

- Result		:  Both models derived from Lasso and Ridge demonstrate promising results, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of less than 20%.

- Tools		: Python (Regression Model)
